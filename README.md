# AWS-FaaS-MQ-System
This repository contains terraform and lambda codes for a small simple system i made as part of my TAship of CS-487 (Cloud Development) It was euphoric to implement a decoupled serverless event triggered system to calculate statistics of a quiz using AWS lambda function, Api gateway, S3, SQS and SNS services.
