# AWS-FaaS-MQ-System
This repository contains Terraform and AWS Lambda code for a lightweight, serverless event-driven system developed as part of my TAship for CS-487 (Cloud Development). The project was an exciting opportunity to implement a decoupled architecture that calculates quiz statistics using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, SQS, and SNS.
